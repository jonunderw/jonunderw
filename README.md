### 📌 About Me  

Hey there, I’m Jon Underwood — a Senior Technical Product Manager with just over 10 years of experience in the world of Product Development. I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University of Mississippi, where I first discovered my passion for building things. 

These days, I’m fascinated by how AI tools can supercharge every step of the product journey—helping ideas take shape faster, making delivery smoother, and opening up new ways for teams to work together.
I’m always learning, experimenting, and sharing what I pick up along the way, hoping it sparks new ideas and saves others a few bumps in the road.
